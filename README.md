# AcL-ActionLearner

## TODO
- Training configs for teacher policies
- Training codes for both teacher policies and the student policy based on [legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym) and [rsl_rl](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl)
- Checkpoints for teacher policies, encoder, and decoder
- Sim2real suitable for loosing-torque faults manipulation based on [rl_sar](https://github.com/fan-ziqi/rl_sar)

## ASKING FOR HELP
We’re afraid of damaging the quadruped, so we haven’t tested the standing and hand-standing gaits in real cases yet. We will sincerely appreciate it if someone can share checkpoints/training configs that are tested to be valid for Go2 in real cases for these two gaits!
